The R script
 makeWaveClimatology.R
computes monthly climatologies for variables specified as
 varList
from the product specified as
 ARCmyWAV

Requirement:
 R library RNetCDF (available from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNetCDF/)

Prior to excecuting the script, three environment variables must be set and exported:
 inPath   (top) directory for existing daily files with results
 outPath  directory to which output files will be written
 Rpath    directory where the  makeWaveClimatology.R  script is available
Note that in the present configuration, input files cover one day each,
and are available as
 ${inPath}/[YYYY]/[MM]/[YYYYMMDD]_MyWam3km_hindcast-cmems.nc


How to run (linux):

inPath=<your implementation>
outPath=<your implementation>
Rpath=<path to this directory>
export inPath outPath Rpath

Rbin=`which R`
R_LIBS=<path to directory from which the R library RNetCDF is available>
export R_LIBS

${Rbin} CMD BATCH makeWaveClimatology.R
